As researcher with a paper accepted to ICPR or one of its workshops, you had probably devote a part of your time to write code. The Reproducible Label propose to make profitable your efforts in software development in order to valorize your research results.

You can see the already labeled codes at this address:

### Who can apply?

Alll authors of an accepted paper at RRPR, ICPR or any ICPR workshop.
[https://github.com/RLPR](https://github.com/RLPR)

### Why apply?

The label proposed by the RRPR committee is an additional recognition of the work presented at the ICPR conference and ICPR Workshops. **The label is a proof that your work can be reproduced** from the git repository that will be indexed by RRPR. This is a major advantage for other researchers wanting to compare their works to yours: the label guarantees that the comparisons are performed with the author implementation used in the corresponding paper. Thereby, it is also a major advantage for you to be compared and cited by your colleagues.

### What is the process?

We propose you to submit the source code used to generate the results/figures of your accepted paper. Your submission will be reviewed, i.e. we will try to compile them and to execute them. Then **we will compare the obtained results with the results of your paper**. If they are consistent, we will deliver to you the Reproducible Label and your source code will be indexed by the Label Repository.

Note that **the source code is NOT reviewed**. We only follow the README instructions to compile the source code and execute the script(s)/binaries.

### How to apply?

You need to provide an URL of a git repository (Github, Gitlab, etc.) containing:

- the source code allowing to reproduce all experiments and/or figures of your paper,
- a README.md file containing all compilation instructions.
- a (set of) script file(s) allowing to install and execute your code,
- a link or reference to the original associated paper.

If the original paper cannot be publicly released or the public link is not yet known, please send a copy of your paper by email.

### Which are the accepted languages/libraries/operating systems?

**All languages and libraries are accepted**. You just need to precise the used versions.
Concerning the operating systems, your code must compile on at least one of the followings:

- Mac OSX 10.12 (Sierra) or later
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Debian 10.0 or later
- Windows 10 or later
